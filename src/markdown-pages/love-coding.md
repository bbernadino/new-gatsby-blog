### Coding is the best.

Coding is the best. Coding is an expression of creativity through technology. Modern technology that some find foreign, difficult, or even weird and nerdy.

My favorite way to go about coding lies in JavaScript or JS. JS is one of the most widely used and most popular programming languages in the whole world!

Here is a description of this intuitive language from wikipedia on [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript):

> Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)is
> a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
> dessert. It may be made from dairy milk or cream, or soy,
> cashew, coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a
> sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice,
> such as cocoa or vanilla. Colourings are usually added, in
> addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to
> incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point
> of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
> The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at
> very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes
> more malleable as its temperature increases.
