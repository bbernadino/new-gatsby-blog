Please take a second to watch this video about one of my favorite hobbies. Not many understand it, and this is a great way to get up to speed!

Now that you're more familiar with the game itself, let me provide a little background about my interest in it.

I've been playing WoW since 2009.

World of Warcraft was my first taste of MMORPG games as they're known today, and I've played others like it. Guild Wars, Elder Scrolls Online, and even Final Fantasy are all on my roster. However, none of them match up.

One of my best friends in the whole world, Joe Ponce, introduced me to World of Warcraft when I was just 13 years old. Soon after, my other best friend Cooper Jones got into it with us. Not long after that, my little brother who is my true best friend got hooked as well. Not only them, but even my dad's partner at work Cyle Hall plays as well! We have our own community in game together of real life and online friends to conquer the games quests and dungeons.

World of Warcraft has been my go to game for over 11 years, and has become one of my most cherished past times spent with my best friends and family members.
