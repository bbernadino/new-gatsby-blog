### Coding is the best.

Coding is the best. Coding is an expression of creativity through technology. Modern technology that some find foreign, difficult, or even weird and nerdy.

My favorite way to go about coding lies in JavaScript or JS. JS is one of the most widely used and most popular programming languages in the whole world!

Here is a description of this intuitive language from wikipedia on [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript):

> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

> Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
